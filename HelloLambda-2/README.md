# Welcome to Lambda Functions!

There we will make a AWS-Lambda Resource.

#### Before Deploying run some commands

```
npm run build -> (Use for Typescript)
cdk bootstrap -> (One-time command for lambdaFunction)
cdk synth -> (For Synthesis)

```
#### Then Deploy:

`cdk deploy`

 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
