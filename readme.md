aws-cdk. So, for that firstly we need some intsallation.

- AWS-CLI

Then we have to configure your AWS, For that run:

aws configure -> (There put your user credentials)

After all these installation on your system. You Need to run a command on your terminal wether it's linux or vscode.

- Make a Directory then,

cdk init app --language typescript
or
clone my repository or particular project.

npm run build -> (For Build TypeScript)
